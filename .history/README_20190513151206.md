## Goal

Understand how to use a JSON, map() and props.

## To do


0. For each value of the `users` array, create a component `<User>` (thanks to [map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)) and pass all the data from the user as **props**
1. Inside the `<User>` component, pass the rest of the data to the `<Contact>` component.


_Hint: You can use the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) to pass the props._
